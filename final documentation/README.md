## Introduction
This project is part of the **Data Engineering Zoomcamp 2025** and serves as the capstone project required to complete the course. The project aims to build an end-to-end data pipeline using cloud infrastructure, orchestration tools, and distributed computing technologies.

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to extract a dataset from Kaggle, process it using Apache Spark, store the processed data in Google Cloud Storage (GCS) and BigQuery, transform it with dbt, and visualize insights using Looker Studio.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of the following files:
- `appearances.csv`
- `players.csv`
- `games.csv`
- `clubs.csv`
- `club_games.csv`
- `game_lineups.csv`
- `player_valuations.csv`
- `transfers.csv`
- `competitions.csv`
