# Final-Project

Let's start from zero, forget the infrastructure you already have:
First steps are:
Setupping GCP and creating a new project and a VM (maybe, make sure about it from the other projects)
Setupping Terraform
Using terraform to create a bucket and a dataset
Setupping Kestra
Extracting data from Kaggle and uploading it to GCS in Kestra



1) Created a GCP account and started a new project: "de-zoomcamp-project" 
2) I followed the instructions in this video: https://youtu.be/ae-CV2KfoN0?si=jq2KO6LgsO2F_D_v to create a create a VM "project-vm" and set it up. 
3) Created a gcs bucket "de-zoomcamp-project-449906_bucket" and bigquery dataset "de_zoomcamp_project_dataset" using Terraform
